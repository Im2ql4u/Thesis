\chapter{Quantum Dots}

We study two-dimensional harmonic quantum dots, a numerically delicate setting
due to the Coulomb singularity at short range and the second-order derivatives
in the kinetic term. Both effects can yield ill-conditioned objectives that
typically require many epochs and small learning rates. We consider
two-electron, six-electron and twelve-electron dots across a wide confinement
range ($\omega\!\in\!\{1.0,\,0.5,\,0.1,\,0.01,\,0.001\}$). 
When $\omega$ becomes sufficiently small, the system approaches the Wigner
molecule limit, where inter-electron distances become large compared to the
confinement length scale and the electrons localize into geometric
arrangements that minimize their mutual repulsion while balancing the trap
potential.
As $\omega$ decreases, the well broadens and correlations strengthen; 
nevertheless, the compact Slater--Jastrow PINN with soft-core pair features
and an explicit analytic cusp remains stable and accurate in practice.
In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of the learned representations,
focusing on the correlator manifold and the backflow field.

\section{Training protocol and energy overview}
Unless otherwise stated, we first apply residual-based pretraining to obtain a
well-conditioned initializer, and then run a Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR)
tail to refine the last digits of the energy. In the residual phase, the
network initially chooses its own target energy as a stabilizer, before we
switch to the DMC reference energy (and optionally add a variance penalty).
The SR phase then uses on the order of $10^3$--$3\times10^3$ iterations with
batches of $\sim 3{\times}10^3$ samples per iteration.

\subsection{Energies}

Table~\ref{tab:Residual} reports two-electron energies from
\emph{residual-only} training (PINN and PINN+BF). For $N{=}2$, backflow is not
required to reach DMC accuracy, but it slightly reduces the variance and
smooths convergence.

Table~\ref{tab:energies} compares diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) references with
our \emph{final} PINN+BF energies after residual pretraining and an SR tail.
From the ultra–shallow two-electron case ($\omega{=}0.01$) to the many-electron
systems, absolute deviations are small; for $N{=}2$ they lie within DMC
uncertainties, and for $N\!\in\!\{6,12\}$ the relative deviations are 
typically in the range $0.01$–$0.08\%$ (see also

\paragraph{Summary.}
A compact Slater--Jastrow PINN with soft-core pair features and an explicit
analytic cusp achieves DMC-level accuracy for $N{=}2$ across all $\omega$, and for
$N\!\in\!\{6,12\}$ reaches small, systematic relative deviations (roughly
$0.01$–$0.08\%$ across the grid; Fig.~\ref{fig:rel_error_vs_omega}). In terms
of sample efficiency, the SR tail uses on the order of $10^3$–$3\times10^3$
iterations with $\sim 3{\times}10^3$ samples each; this is \emph{orders of
magnitude fewer} training samples than some earlier neural approaches to
quantum dots (see \S\ref{sec:related} for a quantitative comparison).
We attribute the stability to conditioning choices (trap-unit scaling,
soft-core features with $ds/dr\!\to\!0$ at coalescence, and an explicit cusp),
which keep both gradients and Laplacians numerically tame from shallow to tight
traps. Convergence traces and ablations (activation, initialization, SR
settings, backflow on/off) are reported in Appendix~X.




\section{What the networks learn}
\label{sec:repr-analysis}

We analyze the learned \emph{correlator} $f_{\text{net}}$ (the residual head fed by
$\overline{\phi}\,\|\,\overline{\psi}\,\|\,\mathbf g$) and the \emph{BackflowNet} by probing their
representations on $|\Psi|^2$ samples. The goal is to understand \emph{what} the networks actually
summarize about the electron cloud, and how this changes from tight, quantum traps into the deep
Wigner regime. To that end we use a common set of diagnostics.

First, we measure the entropy \emph{effective rank} $r_{\text{eff}}$ of the correlator inputs
and of the backflow displacements, as a variance-weighted notion of dimensionality.
Second, we perform PC ablations, projecting inputs onto the top-$k$ principal components and
recomputing the nonlinear head (or the backflow field), so that the decay of reconstruction
error with $k$ reveals how many directions actually matter.
Third, we compute the PC1 \emph{block power}, decomposing the leading axis across branches
$\{\phi,\psi,\text{extras}\}$ to see which part of the architecture dominates.
Fourth, we fit simple linear probes from PCs to coarse physical summaries such as global size
and radial variance. Finally, we analyze \emph{near-field} behaviour by conditioning on the
lowest-$q\%$ of the per-configuration minimum pair distance $r_{\min}$, asking how strongly
the network focuses on very close pairs.

\subsection{Correlator geometry from tight traps to Wigner molecules}

The correlator manifold $Z$ is low-dimensional across all systems, from the two-electron dimer
to the twelve-electron dot, and from tight traps ($\omega=1$) to the deepest Wigner regime
($\omega=10^{-3}$). What changes with $(N,\omega)$ is not the basic rank of the manifold but
the \emph{branch} that supplies the leading axis and the degree to which the manifold thickens
around intermediate confinement.

For tight to moderate confinement, $\omega\in\{1.0,0.5,0.1\}$, the correlator remains compact.
The effective rank stays between $\approx 1.2$ and $\approx 3.0$ for $N\in\{2,6\}$, and between
$\approx 1.9$ and $\approx 2.4$ for $N{=}12$, with the head almost perfectly aligned with its
first principal component. The PC1 branch decomposition shows a clear evolution with $N$ and
$\omega$.

the $N{=}12$ rows are new.}
\label{tab:fnet-geometry-omega-big}
\end{table*}

For $N{=}2$ the correlator is almost one-dimensional at both $\omega=1.0$ and $\omega=0.1$,
with $r_{\rm eff}(Z)\approx 1.25$ and head–PC1 correlation close to one.
The dominant branch shifts from pair-like for the looser trap ($\omega=0.1$) to extras for
the tighter trap ($\omega=1.0$), reflecting the increasing importance of global confinement.
For $N{=}6$ the manifold fattens slightly, peaking at $r_{\rm eff}(Z)\approx 3.0$ for
$\omega=0.5$, where the PC1 axis itself becomes more mixed:
pair features $\psi$ carry most of the power at intermediate and tight traps, while the
per-particle branch $\phi$ dominates at the loosest trap ($\omega=0.1$).
The $N{=}12$ rows show that the same story continues at larger system size.
The head remains almost one-dimensional, with effective rank between $1.88$ and $2.41$ and
alignment above $0.989$, and PC1 is robustly pair-dominated ($\psi\approx 0.78$--$0.80$)
across all three traps.
The slight increase in $r_{\rm eff}(Z)$ toward $\omega=0.1$ indicates a thicker correlator
manifold in the more weakly confined, more strongly correlated quantum regime.

In the deep Wigner regime, $\omega\in\{10^{-2},10^{-3}\}$, the same qualitative picture
persists but $r_{\rm eff}(Z)$ pushes even closer to one and the branch composition reorganizes
once crystalline structure sets in.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The two-electron dot at $\omega=10^{-3}$ is essentially one-dimensional:
$r_{\rm eff}(Z)\approx 1.00$, head–PC1 correlation $0.9976$, and PC1 almost purely in
the pair branch ($\psi\approx 1$).
The slightly stronger confinement at $\omega=10^{-2}$ behaves in essentially the same way.
This shows that for the 2e Wigner molecule the network has effectively discovered a single
pair coordinate that controls the energy.

For $N{=}6$ and $N{=}12$ at $\omega=10^{-3}$ the spectrum remains sharply peaked,
with $r_{\rm eff}(Z)\simeq 1.5$ and head–PC1 alignment $\approx 0.97$.
The PC1 block power again shifts with system size:
for $N{=}6$ PC1 lives almost entirely in the “extras” branch, while for $N{=}12$ it is
dominated by the per-particle/global branch $\phi$ (about $0.52$--$0.53$).
In other words, the medium-sized dot prefers a more pair-like/global mixture, whereas
the large Wigner dot is summarized by a single global axis.

PC ablations confirm that only a handful of principal directions are needed to capture
the head. Across all $(N,\omega)$, a few PCs already reduce the reconstruction error
to the percent level, and by $k{\approx}8$–$12$ the error is well below $10^{-3}$.
Concretely, for $(N,\omega)=(2,10^{-3})$ the relative MAE with only PC1 is about
$0.045$, which drops to $0.0068$ with $k{=}4$ PCs and to $2.0\times 10^{-5}$ with
$k{=}12$. For $(6,10^{-3})$ the corresponding sequence is
$0.20 \to 0.18 \to 0.18 \to 4.1\times 10^{-3}$ for $k{=}1,2,4,8$, and for
$(12,10^{-3})$ it is $0.18 \to 0.16 \to 0.028 \to 5.6\times 10^{-4}$.
Despite the complicated Wigner-molecule structure in real space, the correlator
lives on a very low-dimensional manifold from 2e up to 12e.

\subsection{Head PCs as global size and fluctuation coordinates}

To understand what these latent axes represent physically, we regress simple linear
probes from head PCs to global size and radial variance.
In the deep Wigner limit at $N{=}2$ the single pair-dominated axis almost perfectly
parameterizes the entire radial distribution: $R^2(r_{\rm mean})\approx 0.9999$,
$R^2(r_{\rm var})=1.0$, and $R^2(\Pr(r<0.25))=1.0$, while shell contrast is only
weakly linearly encoded ($R^2\approx 0.02$).
At $N{=}6$ and $N{=}12$ in the same regime the leading PC (plus one or two additional
components) captures global size and fluctuations across the Wigner crossover:
for $(N,\omega)=(6,10^{-3})$ we find $R^2(r_{\rm mean})\approx 0.99$ and
$R^2(r_{\rm var})\approx 0.64$, while for $(12,10^{-3})$ these values are
$\approx 0.996$ and $\approx 0.83$.
Shell contrast remains only weakly linear throughout, consistent with the need
for angular registration to resolve crystalline order.

In the $N{=}12$ quantum traps at $\omega\in\{1.0,0.5,0.1\}$ the same pattern persists.
The leading PCs predict $r_{\rm mean}$ with $R^2$ values $\approx 0.99$, $\approx 0.98$
and $\approx 0.97$, and $r_{\rm var}$ with $R^2$ in the range $0.64$--$0.68$,
while angular measures again require non-linear or rotated probes.
Taken together with Tables~\ref{tab:fnet-geometry-omega-big} and
\ref{tab:fnet-geometry-wigner}, this shows that from tight traps all the way to
the Wigner molecule, the correlator manifold is organized around a small number
of coarse global coordinates that track overall size and radial fluctuations.

\subsection{Backflow: unified results, with interpretation}

Backflow exhibits a regime split that is now quantitatively supported across all
$(N,\omega)$ we studied:
(i) in the deep Wigner limit ($\omega\!=\!10^{-3}$) it is variationally inert and
leaves the correlator manifold essentially unchanged;
(ii) by $\omega\!=\!10^{-2}$, backflow turns on but remains a \emph{local} corrector—
energetically relevant in some systems, yet altering the correlator along only
$\sim$1–2 directions;
(iii) for tighter traps ($\omega\!\in\!\{0.1,0.5,1.0\}$; see
Table~\ref{tab:bf-geometry-omega-big}) the displacement field is high-rank for
$N\!\ge\!6$, requiring many PCs for good reconstruction and showing negligible
linear predictability of global size/variance.

\paragraph{Small-$\omega$ energetics (matched BF samples).}
Table~\ref{tab:bf-energetics-smallomega} reports separate means and standard errors for
no-BF and BF energies, the matched per-configuration difference $\Delta E$, and the
near-field enrichment of that energy change (share carried by the lowest 5\% / 10\% of
$r_{\min}$).

\paragraph{What these numbers \emph{say}.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Deep Wigner limit ($\omega\!=\!10^{-3}$):} $\Delta E$ is micro-Hartree and
  statistically compatible with zero for $N{=}2$ and $12$. PC1 stays colinear (cosine $\approx\!1$),
  $r_{\rm eff}(\Delta Z)\!\approx\!1$–$1.55$, and even though $r_{\rm eff}(\Delta x)$ can be high
  (e.g.\ $\sim\!22$ for $12e$), the field is effectively constant on the sampled manifold (PC
  ablation error $\sim\!10^{-6}$), with \emph{no} near-field preference in either $\Delta E$ or
  $\|\Delta x\|^2$ (shares $\approx\!1$). In short: the pair-correlator saturates the physics and
  backflow does not provide an additional variational gain.
  \item \textbf{Intermediate confinement ($\omega\!=\!10^{-2}$):} backflow turns on but remains
  \emph{low-rank on the correlator}. For $2e$ we see a small, positive $\Delta E$
  ($3.6\!\times\!10^{-4}$ relative), mild PC reweighting
  ($r_{\rm eff}(\Delta Z)\!\approx\!1.00$–$1.85$ across systems), and a clear near-field signal in
  the \emph{energy} for $12e$ (the 5\% bin carries $\sim\!6\times$ its fair share). Meanwhile,
  $\|\Delta x\|^2$ itself is not necessarily concentrated in the near field (for $12e$ the 5\% bin
  carries about its fair share, i.e.\ a factor of $\sim 1$). This means that many spatial modes of
  the displacement field contribute, but the \emph{energetic} leverage of backflow is localized at
  short distances.
  \item \textbf{$6e$ at $\omega\!=\!10^{-2}$ (two runs):} both runs have high-rank $\Delta x$
  ($r_{\rm eff}\!\approx\!9.8$–$10.1$) and low-rank $\Delta Z$ ($1.25$–$1.38$). Energetic gains
  differ (run-to-run variability: $\Delta E \approx 9.0{\times}10^{-5}$ vs.\ $5.4{\times}10^{-4}$\,Ha),
  yet the correlator geometry is stable (PC1 cosine $>\!0.99989$). Near-field $\Delta E$ enrichment is
  modest ($\sim\!1\times$–$1.2\times$), consistent with a \emph{distributed} local correction rather
  than a sharp cusp-only tweak.
  \item \textbf{Locality vs.\ global observables:} linear probes from $\Delta x$ to global size/variance
  remain tiny for $N\!\ge\!6$ (typical $R^2(r_{\rm mean}) \lesssim 2\%$, $R^2(r_{\rm var}) \lesssim 1\%$
  at small $\omega$), reinforcing that backflow is not a global rescaler.%
  \footnote{For $2e$ at $\omega\!=\!10^{-2}$, probes can be large (even $R^2\!\approx\!1$) because the
  geometry is effectively one-dimensional.}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Design takeaway (quantitatively supported).}
Across regimes, the model separates concerns: a compact correlator manifold $Z$ that tracks global
size and radial structure and changes along only $\sim$1–2 directions under backflow, and a
high-rank but \emph{local} displacement field $\Delta x$ that matters energetically only away from
the ultra-classical limit. In the Wigner regime, backflow is variationally silent; by
$\omega\!=\!10^{-2}$ it provides local nodal refinements whose energetic leverage concentrates in
short-distance configurations (especially for $12e$), even when the displacement energy is spread
across many modes.

\subsection{What we measure}
For each $(N,\omega)$ we draw $\mathbf X\!\sim|\Psi|^2$ and report
(i) the pair distribution $g(r)$,
(ii) the single-particle radial law $P(r)\!\propto\!r^{d-1}g(r)$ ($d=2$),
and scalars from $P(r)$: $r_{\rm mode}$, $\langle r\rangle$, $\sigma_r$, FWHM, $q_{10},q_{50},q_{90}$.
We condense localization via
\[
\gamma \;=\; \sigma_r/r_{\rm mode},
\]
(smaller $\gamma$ $\Rightarrow$ stiffer localization).
For $N>2$ we also monitor ring bond–orientational order $|\Phi_m|$ on resolved shells 
and a dimensionless Lindemann-type ratio for nearest-neighbour angular spacings 
(see also bond-orientational diagnostics in classical Wigner-like systems~\cite{Mazars_2008}).

\paragraph{Density parameter $r_s$.}
Following Egger \textit{et al.}~\cite{Egger_1999}, we estimate $r_s$ from the first maximum $r^\ast$ of the (spin-summed) pair correlation,
\(
r_s \equiv r^\ast/a_B^\ast.
\)
The Fermi–liquid $\to$ Wigner–molecule crossover occurs already near $r_s\!\simeq\!4$ in parabolic dots; 
our weak–trap cases lie well beyond this threshold and should display clear Wigner signatures~\cite{Egger_1999,Filinov_2001}.

  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{Energy-based Wigner diagnostics as functions of trap frequency.

  \label{fig:wigner_ratios}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Energy-based crossover diagnostics.}
As a complementary probe we analyze the expectation values of the kinetic energy $T$,
the Coulomb energy $V_{\rm int}$, and the trap energy $V_{\rm trap}$ as functions of $\omega$.
Log–log fits of the form $E(\omega)\propto\omega^{\alpha}$ on the grid
$\omega\in\{10^{-3},10^{-2},10^{-1},0.5,1\}$ give
\[
\alpha_T \simeq 1.00,\qquad
\alpha_{V_{\rm int}} \simeq 0.66,\qquad
\alpha_{V_{\rm trap}} \simeq 0.81,\,0.73,\,0.72
\]
for $N=2,6,12$, respectively. Thus $T$ scales essentially linearly with $\omega$, while both
$V_{\rm int}$ and $V_{\rm trap}$ grow sublinearly with exponents that are nearly $N$-independent.
The ratios
\[
\frac{T}{V_{\rm int}} \;\propto\; \omega^{\alpha_T-\alpha_{V_{\rm int}}}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{T}{V_{\rm trap}} \;\propto\; \omega^{\alpha_T-\alpha_{V_{\rm trap}}}
\]
therefore decrease as power laws with exponents $\alpha_T-\alpha_{V_{\rm int}}\!\approx\!0.32\text{--}0.35$
and $\alpha_T-\alpha_{V_{\rm trap}}\!\approx\!0.19\text{--}0.28$.
Across $\omega\in[1,10^{-3}]$ the interaction-to-kinetic ratio
$\Gamma= \langle V_{\rm int}\rangle/\langle T\rangle$ increases from
$\Gamma\simeq0.9\!\to\!8.7$ ($N=2$), $2.4\!\to\!25.4$ ($N=6$), and $3.6\!\to\!39.9$ ($N=12$),
while $T/V_{\rm int}$ falls correspondingly (Fig.~\ref{fig:wigner_ratios}a), e.g.\
$T/V_{\rm int}$ decreases from $\approx 0.28$ to $\approx 0.025$ for $N=12$.

The partitioning between trap and interaction energies becomes quasi-classical at weak confinement.
At $\omega=10^{-3}$ we find
\[
\frac{2\langle V_{\rm trap}\rangle}{\langle V_{\rm int}\rangle}
\simeq 1.25,\;1.12,\;1.02 \quad\text{for}\quad N=2,6,12,
\]
so that the $N=12$ dot satisfies $V_{\rm int}\!\approx\!2V_{\rm trap}$ to within $2\%$,
as expected for nearly classical charges in a harmonic trap (Fig.~\ref{fig:wigner_ratios}b).
Using $V_{\rm trap} = \tfrac12 \omega^2 \sum_i \langle r_i^2\rangle$ we can extract
a root-mean-square radius
$r_{\rm rms} = \sqrt{2V_{\rm trap}/(N\omega^2)}$.
For $(N,\omega)=(2,6,12;1)$ we obtain
$r_{\rm rms}\!\approx\!1.14,1.62,2.03\,a_B^\ast$, which expands to
$\approx 70,128,169\,a_B^\ast$ at $\omega=10^{-3}$.
Fitting $r_{\rm rms}\propto\omega^{\alpha_r}$ yields
$\alpha_r\simeq-0.60,-0.63,-0.64$ for $N=2,6,12$,
i.e.\ $\langle r^2\rangle\propto\omega^{-\beta}$ with
$\beta\simeq1.19,1.27,1.28$.
The cloud thus expands \emph{faster} than the non-interacting
$\omega^{-1}$ expectation, in line with interaction-driven swelling and
shell formation in the Wigner regime.

% ------------------------- N=2 -------------------------
\subsection{Two electrons ($N=2$): monotone approach to the Wigner side}
As $\omega$ decreases, $r_{\rm mode}$ grows and $\gamma=\sigma_r/r_{\rm mode}$ shrinks
(Table~\ref{tab:two_e_summary}),
with a power-law $r_{\rm mode}\!\sim C\,\omega^{\alpha}$ giving $\alpha\simeq-0.62$ over
$\omega\in\{1,0.5,0.1,0.01\}$, close to the classical two-body scaling $-2/3$.  

At the weakest trap, $\omega=10^{-3}$, the radial diagnostics read
$r_{\rm mode}\approx64.3$, $\langle r\rangle\approx64.0$,
$\sigma_r\approx18.5$, FWHM$\approx44.0$ and
$\gamma\approx0.29$, with only
$\sim 4.6\times 10^{-3}$ of the single-particle mass inside
$r\le 0.25\,r_{\rm mode}$.
The pair distance distribution has mode $r_{12}\approx122$ and
Lindemann $\gamma_{r_{12}}\approx0.20$, while the relative angle
is sharply peaked near $\pi$ with
$\sigma(\pi-\Delta\phi)\approx0.35$ and a tiny near-origin mass
$p(r_{12}\le0.25\,r_{12}^{\rm mode})\approx2.6\times 10^{-3}$.
Together these show a very dilute, strongly anti-aligned Wigner dimer.

\paragraph{Takeaway.}
All observables—growth of $r_{\rm mode}$, shrinking $\gamma$, sharper anti-alignment,
and suppressed near-origin mass—evolve smoothly with decreasing $\omega$,
consistent with the expected two-site Wigner dimer limit.

% ------------------------- N=6 -------------------------
\subsection{Six electrons ($N=6$): one ring persists, correlations stiffen}
Across $\omega\in[1,10^{-3}]$, $N=6$ retains a single pronounced shell; 
localization ratios and Lindemann indices decrease steadily (Table~\ref{tab:N6}).  
This is precisely the ``rotating Wigner molecule'' (RWM) scenario—lab-frame densities are ring-like, 
while crystalline order is recovered after angular registration~\cite{Egger_1999,manninen2007metalclustersquantumdots}.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Weak confinement at $\omega=0.01$.}
A near-degeneracy between the $(1,5)$ and $(0,6)$ sectors is observed, with
\[
(1,5)\ \text{fraction}\approx 0.692,\qquad (0,6)\approx 0.308,
\]
and phase–aligned ring order
\[
|\Phi_5|=0.453\!\pm\!0.214,\ \ \text{Lind}=0.329;\qquad
|\Phi_6|=0.466\!\pm\!0.206,\ \ \text{Lind}=0.315.
\]
The global $g(r)$ is exactly reproduced by the expected inner–inner (II),
inner–outer (IO) and outer–outer (OO) mixture (cosine similarity~$=1.000$).

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{N6_all_densities}
  \caption{Six-electron radial densities $P(r)$ across $\omega$.}
  \label{fig:6N_radial_densities}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Pushing to $\omega=10^{-3}$.}
The ring stiffens further and both symmetry classes persist with high-quality order.
From $K=300{,}000$ frames we obtain
\[
(1,5)\ \text{fraction}\approx 0.801,\qquad (0,6)\approx 0.199,
\]
with phase-aligned ring order
\[
|\Phi_5| = 0.597\!\pm\!0.224,\ \ \text{Lind}\approx0.225;\qquad
|\Phi_6| = 0.663\!\pm\!0.183,\ \ \text{Lind}\approx0.205.
\]
Thus the shell is always present; lab-frame symmetry is restored by rotation,
but in the co-rotating frame the six electrons form a stiff Wigner ring,
predominantly in the $(1,5)$ sector with a significant $(0,6)$ minority.
Classically, $(1,5)$ is favored and $(0,6)$ a proximate competitor; the quantum
mixture at large $r_s$ mirrors this~\cite{schweigert1994spectralpropertieschargedparticles,Kong_2002}.
(In both weak-trap cases the global $g(r)$ is reproduced to numerical precision
by the appropriate II/IO/OO mixtures.)

% ------------------------- N=12 -------------------------

\subsection{Twelve electrons ($N=12$): two shells and commensurability at \boldmath{$\omega=10^{-3}$}}

Already at $\omega=0.01$ the system is well on the Wigner side, with two-shell formation frequent.  
Using a conservative radial-gap threshold $\tau{=}3.0$ we find a two-shell fraction of $0.761$, with inner–ring occupancies
\[
(1,11)=32.639\%,\quad (2,10)=25.688\%,\quad (3,9)=13.716\%,
\]
and bond order / angular fluctuations
\[
\begin{aligned}
&(1,11):\quad |\Phi_{\rm out}|=0.276,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm out}=0.495,\\
&(2,10):\quad |\Phi_{\rm in}|=0.661,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm in}=0.315;\ \ |\Phi_{\rm out}|=0.300,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm out}=0.432,\\
&(3,9):\quad |\Phi_{\rm in}|=0.565,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm in}=0.342;\ \ |\Phi_{\rm out}|=0.322,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm out}=0.408.
\end{aligned}
\]

Upon lowering the trap to $\omega=10^{-3}$, shelling becomes ubiquitous and a \emph{commensurate} split emerges as modal.
For the full $500{,}000$-frame ensemble the two-shell fraction is
\[
f_{\rm 2shell}(\tau) \approx 0.991,\ 0.966,\ 0.923
\quad\text{for}\quad \tau=2.0,2.5,3.0,
\]
with inner–ring occupancy histograms that are very stable under~$\tau$.
At $\tau{=}3.0$ we also consider a stricter two-shell subset, obtained by combining the
radial gap criterion with additional quality cuts (see Appendix~Y); this subset constitutes
$46.15\%$ of all frames and has
\[
(3,9)=43.29\%,\quad (2,10)=19.89\%,\quad (1,11)=12.54\%,
\]
with the remaining weight spread over $(4,8)$, $(5,7)$ and rarer configurations.
The median outer radius in trap units is ${\approx}7.02$, consistent with the
energy-based estimate of a strongly swollen cloud.

On $(3,9)$ frames the rings show strong bond order with small angular Lindemann:
\[
|\Phi_3|=0.687\!\pm\!0.229,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm in}=0.223;\qquad
|\Phi_9|=0.526\!\pm\!0.194,\ \ \text{Lind}_{\rm out}=0.224.
\]
Using a reduced bundle with $K\approx2.5\times 10^5$ frames that satisfy the
two-shell criterion, we construct II/IO/OO histograms and weight them by the
combinatorial mixture $(0.045{:}0.409{:}0.545)$.
The resulting synthetic $g(r)$ has cosine similarity $0.9982$ to the global
$g(r)$, i.e.\ is indistinguishable at our statistical resolution
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:N12_w0001_decomposition}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{mixfit_N12_w0.001_nin3.pdf}
  \caption{Shell-resolved reconstruction of $g(r)$ at $\omega=10^{-3}$ for $N{=}12$.  
  The global pair distribution is reproduced by a convex mixture of inner--inner (II),
  inner--outer (IO) and outer--outer (OO) histograms with weights set by the observed
  $(n_{\rm in},n_{\rm out})$ statistics, confirming that the structure is geometric
  rather than a sampling artifact.}
  \label{fig:N12_w0001_decomposition}
\end{figure}

This is exactly the Wigner-molecule regime: the \emph{radial} structure freezes
into concentric shells, while residual \emph{azimuthal} dynamics mixes a few
low-lying ring occupancies.
The $(3,9)$ commensurate split at the weakest trap aligns with classical
ground-state analyses for parabolic Coulomb clusters~\cite{schweigert1994spectralpropertieschargedparticles,Kong_2002}; 
the finite weight of $(1,11)$ and $(2,10)$ reflects near-degeneracies and
quantum rotational mixing~\cite{manninen2007metalclustersquantumdots,Filinov_2001}.

\paragraph{Significance.}
Taken together, the $\omega=10^{-3}$ results provide a sharp, quantitative realization of the Wigner-molecule picture in parabolic dots:
(i) shell-resolved reconstruction of $g(r)$ at numerical precision,
(ii) strong, commensurate bond order on rings with small angular Lindemann ratios,
(iii) shell-occupancy (``topology'') fractions that smoothly approach the classical ordering as confinement weakens,
all consistent with~\cite{Egger_1999,Filinov_2001,schweigert1994spectralpropertieschargedparticles,Kong_2002}.
Our sector-resolved $|\Phi_m|$ are extracted \emph{within} a fully variational quantum ansatz and measured conditionally on shell occupancy, 
which (to our knowledge) has not been reported before for $N=12$ parabolic dots.
