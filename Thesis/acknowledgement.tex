\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The act of developing a thesis is often seen as a solitary endeavor, as is much in life. However, this is far from the truth. Many people have contributed to this work, and I would like to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to them.
Firstly, the project would not have been initiated if it were not for my supervisor, Prof. Morten Hjorth-Jensen. Thank you for your guidance, support, and for believing in my ideas. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable throughout this journey.
