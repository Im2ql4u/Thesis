### [2026-03-19/20] — Langevin proposal sampling: implementation, failure, and lessons learned

**Motivation:** At N=20 with low ω, the Gaussian mixture proposal has near-zero overlap with |Ψ|² in 40 dimensions, producing ESS≈1 on every epoch. Hypothesis: running K steps of overdamped Langevin dynamics on proposal samples before importance resampling would push them toward high-|Ψ|² regions and fix the sampling catastrophe.
**Method:** Implemented `langevin_refine_samples()` in [src/functions/Neural_Networks.py](src/functions/Neural_Networks.py). The update rule is x' = x + ε·∇log|Ψ|² + √(2ε)·η, with per-sample gradient norm clipping (clip=1.0) and NaN guards. After Langevin, use flat proposal weights (lq=0) since samples should be approximately |Ψ|²-distributed. Tested with K=10-20 steps at ε=0.01-0.05 across N=6 ω=0.001, N=20 ω=0.1, and N=20 ω=1.0.
**Results:** Langevin was consistently worse than standard importance resampling:
| Config | Standard (VMC) | Langevin (VMC) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| N=20 ω=0.1 | +5.4% | +152% (catastrophic) |
| N=20 ω=1.0 | +1.3% | +5.2% |
| N=6 ω=0.001 | +0.22% | +0.30% |
**Interpretation:** K=10-20 Langevin steps from a Gaussian starting point in 40D are far from equilibrium. The resulting sample distribution is neither |Ψ|² nor q(x), so the flat-proposal importance weights are wrong. The biased gradients push the wavefunction to match the biased distribution (positive feedback loop), explaining the +152% catastrophe at N=20 ω=0.1. Langevin proposal refinement requires either (a) much longer chains (K=100+, impractical), (b) a proper Metropolis-Hastings acceptance step, or (c) should be replaced with proper MCMC within training. This was a useful negative result.
**Caveats:** Only tested with short chains; properly equilibrated Langevin (or HMC) might work but at MCMC-level computational cost, negating the advantage of the collocation-only approach.

**Next question:** Is the sampling bottleneck the fundamental limit for collocation at high N, or can architecture improvements (backflow) compensate without fixing sampling?

### [2026-03-19/20] — N=20 Jastrow polishing: significant accuracy improvement

**Motivation:** Historical N=20 Jastrow checkpoints from March 14 transfer campaigns showed +2.6% (ω=1.0), +7.0% (ω=0.5), +5.9% (ω=0.1). These appeared undertrained — could lower LR and patient polishing improve them?
**Method:** Resumed from best checkpoints with LR reduced 2-5x (1e-4 to 5e-5), relaxed rollback thresholds, Adam optimizer. Multiple seeds per omega for cross-validation. Ultra-polish at ω=1.0 uses n-coll=8192 and LR=5e-5.
**Results:**
| N | ω | Before | After (best VMC) | Improvement |
|---|---|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 20 | 1.0 | +2.63% | **+1.32%** | 2.0× |
| 20 | 0.5 | +7.0% | **+2.38%** | 2.9× |
| 20 | 0.1 | +5.9% | **+5.44%** | 1.1× |
**Interpretation:** The March 14 checkpoints were far from convergence — they had capacity but needed more optimization with smaller LR. The Jastrow architecture at N=20 can reach ~1% at ω=1.0 and ~2.4% at ω=0.5. The ω=0.1 result (+5.4%) shows less improvement, suggesting the Jastrow ansatz may be approaching its capacity limit at this N/ω combination (or sampling quality is limiting). Ultra-polish run with 8192 collocation points is still running and may push ω=1.0 below 1%.
**Caveats:** VMC probes use 15-20k samples; final heavy evaluation will be needed for definitive numbers. The collocation energy often shows lower error than VMC (biased importance sampling), so VMC probes are the reliable metric.
**Output reference:** [outputs/2026-03-19_1909_campaign_v3/logs/](outputs/2026-03-19_1909_campaign_v3/logs/), checkpoints in [results/arch_colloc/](results/arch_colloc/)
**Next question:** Can the ultra-polish push N=20 ω=1.0 below 1%? Should we attempt backflow at N=20 with the smaller architecture (bf-hidden=48) now that we have a strong Jastrow warm-start?

### [2026-03-17] — Post-catch-22 synthesis in thesis appendix and hard-regime stabilisation rollout

**Motivation:** After resolving core BF-conditioning issues, the project needed two things: (i) a complete scientific narrative of what was tried and why, and (ii) a targeted stabilisation rollout for unresolved low-omega/high-N regimes.
**Method:** Added a new thesis appendix chapter (`app:postcatch22`) in `Thesis/appendix.tex` with an explicit map of attempted sampling schemes, architecture families, loss/objective styles, optimiser/preconditioner variants, and campaign chronology (natgrad sweeps, SR sweeps, cascade waves, coalescence matrix, and stabilisation runs). In parallel, launched `scripts/stabilize_hard_regimes.py` for N=6 ω=0.1, N=12 ω=0.5, and N=20 ω=1.0 using stricter CG-SR controls (damping anneal, trust-region caps), ESS-adaptive resampling, tempered/clipped importance weights, and rollback logic.
**Results:** Appendix chapter committed and pushed. Stabilisation rollout started successfully; N=6 ω=0.1 transfer branch is actively training near sub-1% error band early in run, while N=12/N=20 branches required relaunch after stale-process OOM and over-strict epoch-0 rollback settings. Corrected v2 launches are now active with relaxed blocking thresholds.
**Interpretation:** The scientific record is now aligned with actual campaign history rather than single-run anecdotes. Operationally, hard-regime stability is strongly coupled to process hygiene (stale workers) and guard aggressiveness (`min_ess`, rollback triggers), not only optimiser choice.
**Caveats:** N=12/N=20 stabilisation branches are in-progress; no final claim update yet. The hard-regime summary remains provisional until final heavy-VMC evaluations complete.
**Output reference:** `Thesis/appendix.tex`, `outputs/2026-03-17_1202_stabilized_hardregimes/`
**Next question:** Can the corrected hard-regime policy deliver monotonic improvement vs cascade baselines for N=12 ω=0.5 and N=20 ω=1.0 without reintroducing variance blowups?

### [2026-03-17] — CG-SR 12-hour campaign: closing the gap to DMC

**Motivation:** Previous work established CG-SR as the best optimizer (Final E=20.165, +0.029% from DMC at N=6 ω=1.0), but three gaps remained: (1) probe-eval discrepancy where VMC probes showed better energies than the final heavy eval, (2) complete failure at ω=0.1 (+43% error due to narrow Gaussian mixture sampling), and (3) no scaling to N=12/N=20.

**Method:** Three fixes applied before launching a 3-phase, 8-GPU, 12-hour campaign:
1. **Auto-widened sigma_fs for low omega** — when ω<0.5 and sigma_fs is at default (0.8,1.3,2.0), automatically widen: ω≤0.15 → (0.4,0.7,1.0,1.5,2.5,4.0), ω≤0.05 → (0.3,0.5,0.8,1.2,2.0,3.5,6.0).
2. **Heavier VMC evaluation** — final eval: burn_in 400→800, thin 3→5, sampler_steps 80→120. Probes: burn_in 200→400, thin 2→3, sampler_steps 40→60. Reduces selection bias (~1.5σ) from picking minimum of ~15 noisy probes.
3. **N=20 architecture fit** — bf-hidden=64, bf-layers=2, micro-batch=128, n-coll=1024 to fit 11GB GPUs.

Campaign structure (scripts/cgsr_campaign.py):
- Phase 1 (0-2h): Fix verification + smoke tests — all 8 GPUs
- Phase 2 (2-8h): Main training from Phase 1 checkpoints — 1200 epochs
- Phase 3 (8-12h): Ultra-low LR refinement — polish Phase 2 winners

Targets: N=6 × {ω=1.0, 0.5, 0.1}, N=12 × {ω=1.0, 0.5}, N=20 × {ω=1.0}. All CG-SR with damping annealing.

**Results (Phase 1 early, ~30 epochs):**
- N=6 ω=1.0: +0.02% (epoch 30) — effectively at DMC reference (20.159)
- N=6 ω=0.5: +0.84% and dropping (warm-started from bf_ctnn_vcycle.pt)
- N=6 ω=0.1: +45-55% (from scratch, sampling fix confirmed working — auto sigma_fs active)
- N=12 ω=1.0: +23.5% (epoch 0, ~45s/epoch)
- N=12 ω=0.5: +45% (epoch 0)
- N=20 ω=1.0: +37% (epoch 10, small arch, fits 11GB)

Campaign is running in tmux session `cgsr_camp`. Full results pending.

**Interpretation:** The sigma_fs auto-widening immediately fixed the ω=0.1 initialization (starting to train instead of stuck). The heavier VMC eval should close the probe-eval gap — Phase 1's N=6 ω=1.0 result will be the first definitive test. N=12/N=20 need many more epochs but are successfully training from scratch.

**Caveats:** Campaign still running. N=20 uses reduced architecture (64 hidden, 2 layers vs default 128 hidden, 3 layers) — may hit a lower accuracy ceiling. Low-ω runs need hundreds of epochs to converge from scratch.

**Output reference:** `outputs/2026-03-17_0031_cgsr_campaign/`

**Next question:** Does the heavier final eval eliminate the probe-eval gap? Can N=6 ω=0.1 reach <1% with CG-SR + widened sampling? Does N=20 with small arch get within 5% of DMC?

### [2026-03-15] — Seed-path fix and stability-tail ablation campaign launch

**Motivation:** Resolve long-standing suspicion that seed differences were not being honored, then test whether tail-regularized resampling improves stability and probe-to-final consistency.
**Method:** Changed config seed default to non-reseeding mode (`seed=None`), threaded trainer CLI seed into weak-form `setup/config.update`, validated post-setup RNG divergence for seeds 11 and 22, added two training controls (importance-weight tempering and log-weight clipping) plus optional selection-time mini-heavy VMC tie-break, and launched a 6-job campaign (`base_hi`, `reg_hi`, `base_lo`, `reg_lo`) via `scripts/stability_core_campaign.py` in tmux with structured outputs.
**Results:** Seed-path validation showed distinct post-setup torch/numpy streams for seed 11 vs 22 (where previously both collapsed to the same sequence after setup); campaign launched successfully with orchestrator + worker processes active and plan ETA around 1.73h wall-clock.
**Interpretation:** A concrete reproducibility threat was present and is now removed for weak-form runs; new campaign is positioned to test whether reduced resampling weight spikiness translates to improved final heavy-VMC behavior.
**Caveats:** Campaign outcomes are still pending; conclusions about regularization benefits are not yet available.
**Output reference:** `outputs/2026-03-15_1453_stability_core_campaign/`
**Next question:** Do regularized variants reduce rollback frequency and probe-final gap while preserving or improving final heavy-VMC error, especially at low omega?

### [2026-03-14] — DMC matrix validation + short collocation pipeline smoke

**Motivation:** Ensure collocation runner uses correct DMC energies across supported particle counts/frequencies before launching a long production run.
**Method:** Added DMC lookup tests and runner-level tests; executed a zero-epoch smoke matrix over all configured DMC table entries; executed a short end-to-end matrix run with 5 epochs per stage to validate orchestration and checkpoint flow.
**Results:** Pytest passed (`19 passed`); smoke matrix validated 19/19 configured entries with `rc=0` and correct `DMC reference` lines for N={2,6,12,20} and all configured omegas; short validation run in [outputs/2026-03-14_1130_overnight_auto](outputs/2026-03-14_1130_overnight_auto) completed Phase A jobs with `returncode=0` and expected checkpoint outputs.
**Interpretation:** DMC references are now correctly sourced from config for all supported combinations, and the refactored collocation/orchestrator pipeline is operational.
**Caveats:** Short validation used only 5 epochs and is not quality-indicative for final physics metrics.
**Output reference:** [outputs/2026-03-14_smoke_collocation/smoke_matrix.json](outputs/2026-03-14_smoke_collocation/smoke_matrix.json), [outputs/2026-03-14_1130_overnight_auto](outputs/2026-03-14_1130_overnight_auto), [outputs/2026-03-14_1135_overnight_auto](outputs/2026-03-14_1135_overnight_auto)
**Next question:** Should the production target matrix be expanded beyond N=6/12 to include N=2 and N=20 runs now that DMC coverage is validated?
